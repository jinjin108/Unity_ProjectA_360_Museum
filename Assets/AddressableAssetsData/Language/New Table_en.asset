    m_Localized: This large stone pagoda stands on the site once occupied by Mireuksa,
      the largest Buddhist temple of the Baekje Period. Currently, only the first
      six stories of the pagoda are intact, leaving some uncertainty as to its original
      height and the number of stories. The prevailing view is that the pagoda was
      probably built during the reign of King Mu (r.600-641) at the end of the Baekje
      Period.

      like that of a wooden pagoda. Each side of the first stone support of the pagoda\u2019s
      body is divided into three spaces, the middle one of which has an opening so
      that the pagoda can be entered from all four directions, and there is a huge
      square pillar at the center of its interior."

      laid wood on an architrave and architrave on the pillar like a wooden structure.
      The roofstone is thin and wide, and rises a little at the four corners. From

    m_Localized: It is regrettable that the collapsed upper stories have been cemented,
      but it is none the less the oldest and largest extant stone pagoda in Korea.
      It is also a very valuable cultural heritage that faithfully illustrates the
      transition from wooden to stone pagodas.

    m_Localized: Daegunjubo has a turtle-shaped handle and a turtle body. According
      to the turtle-type new style, the word "Daegunjubo," which means the grand
      monarch of Daejoseon, is engraved in the full text of the old book. The "National
      Seal Daegunjubo" was produced by King Gojong to use it as a "national seal"
      that aims to become an independent country frequently in ratification between
      countries or official documents to express the sovereignty of the country externally
      during the Gabo period. Later, on October 11, 1897, King Gojong ascended the
      throne from Wongudan to change the country from Joseon to the Korean Empire,
      and the national seal was changed to the Korean National Seal. Accordingly,
      in January 1899, Emperor Gojong used the "Daegunjubo" from this time on, and
      the "Daegunjubo" was no longer used.
